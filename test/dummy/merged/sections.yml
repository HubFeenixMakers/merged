  :header: Studios
  :text: Hub Feenix is a place to create together. A community of artists and makers.
    Several floors of the building are reserved for artist studios. Some creative
    activities that require large equipment (presses, ovens) overlap strongly with
    the Makers idea. Have a look at the rooms available and tell us what you need.

  :header: Sizes and kinds
  :text: We offer different sizes and different types of studios for artists. There
    large and small rooms, with more or less light, also rooms with tiles for wet-work.
    The rooms are in the old hospital wings, so most are old patient rooms, but there
    are plenty of others too. Prices do not include electricity or vat, but do include
    the use of common spaces, see below.

  :header: Residency and Accommodation
  :text: We offer short to medium term accommodation for several target groups. The
    rooms are generally of a corridor, either with or without own toilet and shower.
    This can suit artists who either rent a studio or use co-working facilities. But
    we also accept applications from people who are just between things.
